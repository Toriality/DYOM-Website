# DYOM Website

Welcome to our attempt to recreate the official DYOM website in a improved and more modernized way!

## Goals

The original DYOM website was created in 2008 and it was last updated in 2011. Sadly, since the last update, the site has some annoying bugs, it looks old-fashioned, and a bit difficult to use on mobile devices. Given that, we believe that a complete overhaul of the site would significantly benefit the entire DYOM Community.

Our primary objective is to recreate the website using the latest and most reliable tools available, including front-end, back-end, and database technologies. The new website aims to be user-friendly and designed with a modern look and feel.

## Status

**Front-end: <span style="color:#f55">Paused</color>**<br>
**Back-end: <span style="color:#ff5">Work In Progress</span>**

Currently, we're working on developing the back-end of the website, while the front-end development is temporarily paused.

As the sole developer, I, Toriality, believe that the project's scale is too big for one person to handle alone. Therefore, I'm dedicating my efforts to creating a organized and comprehensive back-end structure. By focusing on developing a reliable back-end, we can ensure that the site's server structure is stable and prepared for the future front-end development.

If you're interested in contributing to the project, we welcome any assistance, whether it's for front-end or back-end development. Please feel free to contact me, or report issues, or make pull requests.
